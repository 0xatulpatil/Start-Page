# Tilde

Inspired by [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)&mdash;Tilde is a
browser homepage that is functional and chic.

## Basic Usage

To go to a site, type the corresponding key and press return. e.g:

- `t` will redirect you to [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/home)
- `b` will redirect you to [dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular)

To access any other site, enter the URL directly. e.g:

- `example.com` will redirect you to [example.com](https://example.com)

To search a site, type a space after the site&rsquo;s key followed by your
query. e.g:

- `g tilde` will [search GitHub for tilde](https://github.com/search?q=tilde)
- `y kittens` will
  [search YouTube for kittens](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kittens)

A DuckDuckGo search will be triggered if your input doesn&rsquo;t match a key.
e.g:

- `google` will [search DuckDuckGo for google](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=google)

To go to a specific path on a site, type the path after the site&rsquo;s key.
e.g:

- `r/r/startpages` will redirect you to
  [reddit.com/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)
- `h/popular` will redirect you to [hypem.com/popular](http://hypem.com/popular)
